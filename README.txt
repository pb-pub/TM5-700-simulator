TM5-700 Simulator

This repository contains a MATLAB-based simulator for the TM5-700 robotic arm. The simulator includes tools for forward and inverse kinematics, workspace visualization, and robot motion simulation.

How to Run

Running the App:
1. Open terminal
2. run : matlab -r "run('robotSimulation.mlapp');"
or 
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the folder containing this repository.
3. Run the "robotSimulation.m"lapp script by typing the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:
   robotSimulation


Running the Main Script:
1. Open MATLAB.
2. Navigate to the folder containing this repository.
3. Run the "main.m" script by typing the following command in the MATLAB Command Window:
   main
4. Follow the instructions displayed in the Command Window or observe the visualizations generated by the script.
